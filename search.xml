The most important reason of establishing my blog is to communicate with those who have the same questions as me. I believe communication can improve both of us. So, I am glad to recieve comments from browsers.</p><p>Second, I want to use this blog to discipline myself and push me to study harder. Before long, I will upload my monthly plans and summarys on this platform. Hope everyone can supervise my study and works.</p><p>last, many Mr.big have their personal blogs and upload marvelous passeges on it. So, I think if I want to be one of them, imitating how they learn can be a good start.</p><hr><h3 id="How-I-establish-my-blog"><a href="#How-I-establish-my-blog" class="headerlink" title="How I establish my blog"></a>How I establish my blog</h3><p>After confirmed I want to have my own blog, I searched the methods of establishing personal blog<br>on the internet. Many answers recommended github pages plus hexo. From these answers, I knowed that the advantage of github pages plus hexo is <em><strong>individuation and for free</strong></em>. That’s what I want. So I choose it.</p><p>Here are some links(very detailed) about how to establish your personal blog:</p><p>(1)<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/69207995" title="This is the guidance I use">使用Github Pages和Hexo搭建自己的独立博客</a></p><p>(2)<a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/69207995" title="This blog is also very good">Hexo+GitHub-page&#x3D;My_Blog!</a></p><p>When I followed these guidances and built my blog, some unexpected mistakes happened like this page(<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/452637478">hexo部署博客后只显示网址怎么办？</a>) described. Then I found that it was my settings that were wrong. When you create a new repository, you should change the branches from <strong>main</strong> to <strong>master</strong>. Here is the solution in detail(<a href="https://blog.csdn.net/xuchaoxin1375/article/details/111414527">github_修改当前仓库的默认分支</a>).</p><hr><h3 id="What-I-want-to-share-on-my-blog"><a href="#What-I-want-to-share-on-my-blog" class="headerlink" title="What I want to share on my blog"></a>What I want to share on my blog</h3><p>I am a student majored in physics and I am also interested in math, cs and literature (both Chinese and foreign literature). So, I want to share knowledge about physics, math and cs I learned during my college study and also some personal feelings after reading books.</p><h3 id="To-Be-Continue……"><a href="#To-Be-Continue……" class="headerlink" title="To Be Continue……"></a>To Be Continue……</h3>]]></content>
